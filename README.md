The **goal of this project** is to investigate trends in U.S. car accidents and use it to develop a machine learning regression model that will predict the severity of collision if it were to occur in a particular city. Severity is defined within a range of integers, **1 to 4** and which represent the following:
<ul><li>1 - Short Delay</li>
    <li>2 - Manageable Delay</li>
    <li>3 - Extended Delay</li>
    <li>4 - Long Delay</li></ul>
